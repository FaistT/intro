            <p>As you come to him, the living Stone, rejected by human beings but chosen by God and precious to him. In little more than a year you who feel secure will tremble; the grape harvest will fail, and the harvest of fruit will not come. The LORD your God will circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your descendants, so that you may love him with all your heart and with all your soul, and live. Then Shaphan the secretary went to the king and reported to him: "Your officials have paid out the money that was in the temple of the LORD and have entrusted it to the workers and supervisors at the temple." But all of you who held fast to the LORD your God are still alive today. But we prayed to our God and posted a guard day and night to meet this threat. After Abram returned from defeating Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him, the king of Sodom came out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley). Then Boaz said, "On the day you buy the land from Naomi, you also acquire Ruth the Moabite, the dead man's widow, in order to maintain the name of the dead with his property."</p>
